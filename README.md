# Next.js + Tailwind CSS + Typescript Template

This template uses [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) [(v2.2)](https://blog.tailwindcss.com/tailwindcss-2-2) with Next.js. It follows the steps outlined in the official [Tailwind docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/nextjs).

It uses the new [`Just-in-Time Mode`](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/just-in-time-mode) for Tailwind CSS.

## How to use - clone the template to your project using git

if the destination is empty:

```bash
git clone [your_origin] <name>
```

if the destination is not empty:

```bash
git init

git remote add origin [your_origin]

git fetch

git checkout origin/main -b main
```

remove old or current url and replace it with new url:

```bash
git remote set-url --delete origin https://github.com/github_id/old/current_application_name.git

git remote set-url --add origin https://github.com/github_id/new_application_name.git

```

Execute with npm or with yarn to bootstrap the template and install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn
# or
yarn install
```

yarn-upgrade-all has been added to the dev dependencies. To update all dependencies run:

```bash
yarn yarn-upgrade-all
```
